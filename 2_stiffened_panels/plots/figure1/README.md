# Panel Buckling modes for Figure 1
Goal is to showcase the different types of panel buckling modes for different materials, stiffener designs, panel sizes/shapes.

### Panel 1 - Metal (Aluminum) axial loading, mid-high AR, 3 stiff
* Aluminum AL-MS89 alloy, isotropic
* stiffAR = 5, nstiff = 3, gamma = 1.0
* rho0 = 2.5, SR = 100.0, b = 1.0
* nelems 2000

### Panel 2 - Composite axial loading, low AR, 9 stiff
* Solvay 5320 composite with [45,-30,0] composite layup
* stiffAR = 5, nstiff = 9, gamma = 3.0
* rho0 = 0.5, SR = 100.0, b = 1.0
* nelems 2000

### Panel 3 - Composite shear, mid-high AR, 6 stiff
* Hexcel IM7 composite with [45,-30,0] composite layup
* stiffAR = 5, nstiff = 6, gamma = 0.5
* rho0 = 3.2, SR = 100.0, b = 1.0
* nelems 2000

### Panel 4 - Metal (Titanium) shear, low AR, 4 stiff
* stiffAR = 5, nstiff = 6, gamma = 2.0
* rho0 = 0.65, SR = 100.0, b = 1.0
* nelems 2000
