# Concept Based on NASA TM - HSCT Manuscript
NOTE : Figure 4.21 is a great view of the Mach 2.4 geometry.
Target TOGW - 750,000 lb or 3,336,166 N aka 3.3 MN
Target range 5000 - 6000 nmi aka 10,000 km (across ocean)
Payload - 250 to 300 passengers
Intended flight conditions:
    Mach 2.0 to 3.2 over ocean
    Mach 0.9 over land (commercial supersonic flight illegal over land in U.S.)
Main concept of the design at Mach 2.4
- Four variable-cycle dry turbofans are aft-mounted on the lower surface of the wing in single nacelles 
- petroleum jet fuel stored in wing tanks (TSJF or thermally stable jet fuel)
- titanium alloy material (see figure 4.3)
- no leading edge cooling, propulsion system or body cooling necessary at this speed
not until you get into the hypersonic regimes
- delta wing with horizontal tail (not canard) was selected as the best design from NASA concept screening
